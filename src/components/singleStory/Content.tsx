            You know how you get a little obsessed with 
            things you love? Yeah! I’m guilty of that with
            Motion Design. I often spend a good amount of 
            time in motion design communities and portfolio 
            platforms swooning over amazing designs and 
            analyzing the creative processes behind them 
            for inspiration. From these explorations, 
            one can easily reaffirm that the final renders 
            that leave our jaws on the floor are just a 
            fraction of the whole process. A lot happens 
            behind the scene, a lot of ideating, 
            sketching,...and a lot of storyboarding.
